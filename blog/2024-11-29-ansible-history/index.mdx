# What is Ansible? A brief history

[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) is an open-source automation tool that helps system administrators and DevOps teams manage servers, deploy applications, and orchestrate complex IT tasks through simple, human-readable code. Created in [2012](#the-founding-of-ansible), it quickly gained popularity by eliminating common automation headaches: no agents needed to be installed, no complex master-slave setup required, and tasks could be written in straightforward YAML files rather than complicated programming languages.

Before Ansible, managing hundreds of servers meant either writing complex shell scripts or dealing with heavyweight configuration management tools that required significant setup. This article traces Ansible's journey from a solution to these everyday headaches to becoming one of the most widely-used automation tools in modern DevOps.

At its core, Ansible is an open-source automation tool that handles configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. What sets it apart is its simplicity: it uses [SSH](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ssh_connection.html) for connectivity, requires no agents on managed nodes, and employs YAML for defining automation tasks.

## Chapter 1: The genesis of Ansible

### The IT landscape before Ansible
Before Ansible emerged, we were stuck with limited options. Tools like [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/) and [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) were powerful but came with significant overhead:
- They required agents on every managed node
- Had steep learning curves with their DSLs (Domain Specific Languages)
- Needed complex master-slave architectures
- Required significant bootstrap configuration

For many teams, this meant either sticking with manual processes or investing heavily in training and infrastructure setup before seeing any benefits.

### The founding of Ansible
In [2012](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/f31421576b00f0b167cdbe61217c31c21a41ac02), [Michael DeHaan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldehaan/), who previously worked on tools like [Cobbler](https://cobbler.github.io/) at Red Hat, created Ansible with a radical approach: what if we could have powerful automation without all the complexity? DeHaan founded Ansible, Inc. with a clear vision of making automation accessible to everyone, not just specialized teams.

What really resonated with developers and sysadmins was Ansible's core philosophy:
- **Agentless Architecture**: Using existing SSH infrastructure meant no new security concerns
- **YAML-Based**: Writing automation in YAML made it readable even for non-programmers
- **Push-Based Model**: Instead of agents polling for changes, control nodes push changes when needed
- **Idempotency**: Running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result

This approach was revolutionary because it aligned with Unix philosophy: do one thing well, make it simple, and make it work with other tools.

## Chapter 2: Ansible's rise to prominence

### Early reception and adoption
When Ansible was first released, the response from the community was [overwhelmingly positive](https://mindshards.com/posts/a-better-chef-ansible/). The tool's simplicity and effectiveness resonated strongly with users. Unlike its competitors, Ansible didn't require a steep learning curve or complex infrastructure changes. This accessibility led to rapid adoption, especially among teams looking for a straightforward solution to automate their workflows.

Ansible's agentless architecture and use of SSH were game-changers. While tools like Puppet and Chef were powerful, they required agents and complex configurations. Ansible's approach was different: it was lightweight, easy to set up, and didn't require additional software on managed nodes. This made it particularly appealing to teams that needed to scale quickly without the overhead of managing additional infrastructure.

### Key milestones in development
- **The Release of [Ansible 1.1](https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/) (2013)**.
- **Introduction of major features**: Over time, Ansible introduced [Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html), [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html), and [modules](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-an-ansible-module), which significantly enhanced its functionality. Playbooks allowed users to define complex automation tasks in a simple, readable format, while roles and modules provided reusable components that streamlined automation processes.

### The Open Source Community
Ansible's success can be largely attributed to its vibrant open-source community. [Contributors](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/graphs/contributors) from around the world played a crucial role in shaping the tool, expanding its capabilities, and integrating it with other technologies. The community-driven development model ensured that Ansible remained relevant and adaptable to the ever-changing needs of IT automation.

## Chapter 3: Red Hat's acquisition of Ansible

### The acquisition process (2015)
In October 2015, the automation world was shaken by significant news: Red Hat had [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/16/red-hat-is-buying-it-automation-startup-ansible-reportedly-for-around-100m/) Ansible for a staggering $150 million. This wasn't just another corporate acquisition; it represented a strategic move that would reshape the future of automation tools. [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), already a powerhouse in the open-source world, saw in Ansible what many developers had already recognized - a tool that could revolutionize enterprise automation while maintaining its open-source roots.

The acquisition came at a crucial time in the automation landscape. Organizations were increasingly moving towards DevOps practices, and the need for simple, scalable automation tools was greater than ever. Red Hat's decision to acquire Ansible wasn't just about adding another tool to their portfolio; it was about embracing a philosophy that aligned perfectly with their vision of enterprise automation.

Key aspects of the acquisition included:
- Maintaining Ansible's open-source nature
- Integration with Red Hat's enterprise products
- Expansion of development resources
- Preservation of the existing community structure

The acquisition brought significant changes to Ansible's development. With Red Hat's resources, Ansible evolved from a community tool to an enterprise solution.

Ansible became deeply integrated with Red Hat's product lineup:
- [OpenShift integration](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/automate-openshift-with-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform) for container orchestration
- [CloudForms](https://www.redhat.com/ja/blog/get-more-out-cloudforms-ansible) integration for hybrid cloud
