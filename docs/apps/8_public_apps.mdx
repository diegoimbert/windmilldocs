# Public Apps

Windmill apps are custom-made user interfaces meant to interact with scripts and flows.

By default, [deployed](./6_app_deployment.mdx) apps are [accessible to](../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx) all users that belong to the [folder](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx) the app was deployed to.

![Secret Public URL](../assets/apps/5_public_apps/public_app.png "Secret Public URL")

A "Public" app is an app that can be seen and used by users outside this scope (i.e.) folder.

When deployed, an app automatically has a secret public URL.

By default, the public URL can be accessed only by logged-in users with [read-access](../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx).

You can also toggle "No login required" and anyone with the secret public URL will be able to access the app.
