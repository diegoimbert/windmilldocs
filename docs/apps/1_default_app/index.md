# Workspace Default App

If configured, users who are [operators](../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx) in this workspace will be redirected to this app automatically when logging into this workspace.

Make sure the default app is [shared with all the operators](../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx) of this workspace before turning this feature on.

Set up the app from workspace settings:

![Set up default app](./set_default_app.png "Set up default app")

Operators will have it open right when logging into the workspace:

	controls
	src="/videos/default_app_operator.mp4"
