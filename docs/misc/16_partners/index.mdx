# Windmill Partners

Windmill Certified Partners are consultancies and agencies that are Windmill's experts and are known to give great results.

## How to become an official partner

Any organization wishing to add value to Windmill is welcome to apply to Windmill's partnership program. A partner can provide consulting, technical implementation assistance, or add-on services.

Windmill being a broad product, we will define certifications for specialization that partners can apply to. For each of those selected, applicants will be tested.
Certifications are to be renewed every 6 months.

Benefits of being a Windmill Certified Partner include:
- Being listed on a partners page with their relevant skills.
- Being sent customers directly by the Windmill team.
- A badge in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB) and relevant medium to show that you are partners with us.

Windmill takes no commission in services provided by its partners. Partners' customers do not need to use the [Enterprise Edition](/pricing) version of Windmill but we ask that partners act as such and thus redirect customers to engage with us for questions, features requests that go outside of the scope of use-case building. We also ask that you do not suggest to go around features that would be offered by the Enterprise Edition version.

If you wish to become a partner, please send an email to [contact@windmill.dev](mailto:contact@windmill.dev).

Hosting Windmill for your own clients is also an option and is covered under our [Whitelabeling license](../8_white_labelling/index.mdx).
