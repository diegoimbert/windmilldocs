## Expanding Windmill's Integrations: Adding New OAuth Providers

To enhance Windmill's connectivity and integration capabilities, we welcome contributions that add new OAuth providers. This not only broadens the range of services Windmill can interact with but also directly impacts the platform's functionality and user experience.

**How to Contribute a New OAuth Provider**:
Submit a Pull Request: Add your new OAuth provider configuration to the [backend/oauth_connect.json](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/backend/oauth_connect.json) file with the following format:

```json
"<name_of_resource_type_for_integration>": {
     "auth_url": "<auth_url>",
     "token_url": "<token_url>",
     "scopes": <the list of default scopes to suggest by default>,
     "extra_params": {
         "<key>": "<val>",
     }
 },
```

Where `extra_params` is an escape hatch to deal with OAuth provider that need
some extra fields to be passed along to the authorization URL.

You can iterate without requiring a dev setup. The item accepts an extra optional field: `connect_config` or `login_config` of type OAuthConfig:

```
interface OAuthConfig {
    auth_url: string,
    token_url: string,
    userinfo_url?: string,
    scopes?: string[],
    extra_params?: Record<string, string>,
    extra_params_callback?: Record<string, string>,
    req_body_auth?: bool
}
```

`connect_config` is used for resources, and `login_config` for SSO.
