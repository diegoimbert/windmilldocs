# White Labeling Windmill

Windmill provides a library to embed the entire Windmill app or specific components - such as the [Flow editor](../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or the [App editor](../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) - with a simplified UI into your own application or website. This enables you to provide Windmill's services to your clients while maintaining your brand's identity.

Windmill offers an [SDK compatible with any framework](../15_react_sdk/index.md), simplifying its integration across various platforms. It can be built in collaboration with us using React/Svelte and our full SDK.

In particular, for React, we have a [webpack](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-whitelabelling-react-webpack) that uses an SDK that will contain all components from Windmill frontend.
For now, the App Viewer and Flow Builder are already available. The embed was made easy.
Check our [Demo](https://windmill-sdk-example.com/) of using the Windmill SDK backed by app.windmill.dev to whitelabel Windmill's Flow Builder and App Viewer in a React app using the default create-react-app template.

Also, [Private Hub](../../core_concepts/32_private_hub/index.mdx) is available for white labeling. It allows you to have your own platorm and approval process for scripts, flows, apps and resource types suggested within app.

Whitelabelling requires a special license and the package @windmill-labs/windmill-react-sdk is not public. Please contact us at sales@windmill.dev,
on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB), or schedule a [meeting](https://www.windmill.dev/book-demo) to get stated.
