# White Labeling Windmill

Windmill offers white labeling capabilities, allowing you to customize the Windmill platform to align with your brand.

We do provide a library to embed the entire Windmill app or specific components - such as the flow builder or the app builder - with a simplified UI into your own application or website. This enables you to provide Windmill's services to your clients while maintaining your brand's identity.

Windmill offers an [SDK compatible with any framework](../15_react_sdk/index.md), simplifying its integration across various platforms. It can be built in collaboration with us using React/Svelte and our full SDK.

Whitelabel SDKs are also available for cloud with any package. Please contact us for more details.

[Private Hub](../../core_concepts/32_private_hub/index.mdx) is available for white labeling. It allows you to have your own platorm and approval process for scripts, flows, apps and resource types suggested within app.

For more information about white labeling and customization options, please reach out to us at contact@windmill.dev, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB), or schedule a [meeting](https://www.windmill.dev/book-demo).
