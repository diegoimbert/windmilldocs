# Email triggers
 
Scripts and flows can be triggered by sending an email to a specific address. 
Here is how to set it up:

First, make sure that port 25 is exposed either on your instance public IP or a separate IP and that it redirects to the windmill app on port 2525.
The Caddyfile already contains the necessary configuration for this. 
For kubernetes, you will find example configurations for some providers on the [Windmill helm charts repository](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts?tab=readme-ov-file#kubernetes-hosting-tips)

In addition, you will need to create one or two records in your DNS provider depending on your setup.

If port 25 is exposed on the same IP as the Windmill instance (e.g. Docker Compose with Caddy):
  - An MX record from `<email domain>` to `<instance domain>`

If port 25 is exposed through a different IP (e.g. Kubernetes):
  - An A/CNAME record that points to the IP of the windmill instance with port 25 exposed (for example `mail_server.<instance domain>` but you can choose any domain you want)
  - An MX record from `<email domain>` to the record defined above (`mail_server.<instance domain>` if following the example)

You can choose any email domain, we suggest using `mail.<instance domain>`.
Once you have defined the DNS settings, set the email domain in the instance settings under the "Core" tab.

You will now find the specific email address to use in the webhooks panels for each script and flow. 
The email address take the form `<workspace>+<path>+<token>@mail.<instance domain>`.
Your script will receive two arguments: 
- `raw_email`: the raw email as string
- `parsed_email`: the parsed email which should make it easier to extract the information you need ([format](https://docs.rs/mail-parser/latest/mail_parser/struct.Message.html))
