# Email Triggers
 
Scripts and flows can be triggered by email messages sent to a specific email address, leveraging [SMTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-smtp/).

First, make sure that the port 25 is exposed either on your instance public IP or a separate IP and that it redirects to the Windmill app on port 2525.
The Caddyfile already contains the necessary configuration for this. 
For Kubernetes, you will find example configurations for some providers on the [Windmill helm charts repository](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts).

In addition, you will need to create one or two records in your DNS provider depending on your setup.

If the port 25 is exposed on the same IP as the Windmill instance (e.g. Docker Compose with Caddy):
  - An MX record from `mail.<instance domain>` to `<instance domain>`.

If the port 25 is exposed through a different IP (e.g. Kubernetes):
  - An A/CNAME record that points to the IP of the Windmill instance with port 25 exposed (for example `mail_server.<instance domain>`).
  - An MX record from `mail.<instance domain>` to the record defined above (`mail_server.<instance domain>` if following the example).

You can choose any email domain, we suggest using `mail.<instance domain>`.
Once you have defined the DNS settings, set the email domain in the instance settings under the "Core" tab.

You will now find the specific email address to use in the webhooks panels for each script and flow. 
The email address takes the form `<path/hash>+<workspace+path/hash+token base32 encoded>@<email domain>`.
Your script will receive two arguments: 
- `raw_email`: the raw email as a string
- `parsed_email` the parsed email with the following attributes:
  - `headers` a dictionary with the email headers (e.g. `from`, `to`, `subject`, `date`)
  - `text_body` the text body of the email (or textified html body if none)
  - `html_body` the html body of the email (or htmlified text body if none)
  - `attachments` list of attachments with the following attributes:
    - `headers` a dictionary with the attachment headers
    - `body` the attachment data (base64 encoded if binary)
