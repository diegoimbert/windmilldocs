# Browser Automation

Windmill makes it easy to perform browser automation tasks, such as testing or web scraping.

:::info
Not sure what a worker group is? You should probably [read about it first](/docs/core_concepts/worker_groups).
:::

By default, a worker group named `reports` is available which will handle jobs with the `chromium` tag.
Workers assigned to this group will install chromium on start (learn more about [init scripts](/docs/core_concepts/worker_groups#init-scripts)).
You have to set the worker group of at least one worker to `reports`.
There is a sample worker container definition called `windmill_worker_reports` in the `docker-compose.yml` file which you can uncomment to quickly start a worker with the right worker group.

The chromium binary will be available on these workers at `/usr/bin/chromium`.
You will need to disable the sandbox to run it inside windmill workers. 
You can do this by passing the `--no-sandbox` flag. 

:::caution
Running chromium without the sandbox is a security risk. Make sure you trust the website you are visiting.
:::

To run jobs on a chromium-equipped worker, you have to select the `chromium` tag in the settings of the script or flow step.
[Learn how here](/docs/script_editor/worker_group_tag).


## Examples using Puppeteer

Here are some basic examples using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to get you started with chromium in Deno, Bun, and Python.

### Deno

```typescript
import puppeteer from "npm:puppeteer-core";

export async function main() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: "new",
    executablePath: "/usr/bin/chromium",
    args: ["--no-sandbox"],
    //userDataDir: "./user-data", // this is only required when Windmill is running with nsjail where you don't have access to the default user data dir
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://google.ch");

  const title = await page.title();

  await browser.close();

  return title;
}
```

### Bun

```typescript
import puppeteer from "puppeteer-core";

export async function main() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: "new",
    executablePath: "/usr/bin/chromium",
    args: ["--no-sandbox"],
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://google.ch");

  const title = await page.title();

  await browser.close();

  return title;
}
```



### Python

```python
from pyppeteer import launch
import asyncio

async def pup():
    browser = await launch(executablePath="/usr/bin/chromium", args=["--no-sandbox"])
    page = await browser.newPage()
    await page.goto('https://google.com')
    title = await page.title()
    await browser.close()
    return title

def main():
    return asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(pup())
```
