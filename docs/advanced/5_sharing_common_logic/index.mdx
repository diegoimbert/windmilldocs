# Sharing Common Logic

It is common to want to share common logic between your scripts. This can be done easily using relative imports in both Python and TypeScript.

Note that in both the webeditor and with the CLI, your scripts do not necessarily need to have a main function. If they don't, they are assumed to be shared logic and not runnable scripts.

It works extremely well in combination with [Developing scripts locally](../4_local_development/index.mdx) and you can easily sync your scripts with the [CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx).

## Python relative imports for sharing common logic

It is possible to import directly from other Python scripts. One can simply
follow the path layout. For instance,
`import foo from f.<foldername>.script_name`. A more complete example below:

```python
# u/user/common_logic

def foo():
  print('Common logic!')
```

And in another Script:

```python
# u/user/custom_script

from u.user.common_logic import foo

def main():
  return foo()
```

It works with Scripts contained in folders, and for scripts contained in
user-spaces, e.g: `f.<foldername>.script_path` or `u.<username>.script_path`.

You can also do relative imports to the current script. For instance.

```python
# if common_logic is a script in the same folder or user-space
from .common_logic import foo
# otherwise if you need to access the folder 'folder'
from ..folder.common_logic import foo
```

Beware that you can only import scripts that you have view rights on at time of execution.

The folder layout is identical with the one that works with the CLI for syncing
scripts locally and on Windmill. See [Developing scripts locally](../4_local_development/index.mdx).

## Deno or Bun relative imports for sharing common logic

Similarly to Python, it is possible to import directly from other TypeScript scripts. One can simply follow the path layout. For instance,
`import { foo } from "/f/<foldername>/script_name.ts"`. A more verbose example below:

```typescript
import { main as foo, util } from '../my_script_path.ts';
```

Relative imports syntax is much preferred as it will work on [local editors](../4_local_development/index.mdx).

You may also use absolute imports (but won't work on local editors):

```typescript
import { main as foo, util } from '/f/common/my_script_path.ts';

export async function main() {
	await foo();
	util();
}
```

Note that path in Windmill can have as many depth as needed, so you can have paths like this `f/folder/subfolder/my_script_path.ts` and relative imports will work at any level. Hence, it will work exactly the same as on local.

### Bundle per Script built by CLI

This method can only be deployed from the [CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx), on [local development](../4_local_development/index.mdx).

To work with large custom codebases, there is another mode of deployment that relies on the same mechanism as similar services like Lambda or cloud functions: a bundle is built locally by the CLI using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and deployed to Windmill.

This bundle contains all the code and dependencies needed to run the script.

Windmill CLI, it is done automatically on `wmill sync push` for any script that falls in the patterns of includes and excludes as defined by the [wmill.yaml](../../core_concepts/33_codebases_and_bundles/index.mdx#wmillyaml) (in the codebase field).

## Bash logic sharing

You can reuse bash scripts by fetching them "raw" and source them. The url is as follows:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <Token>" <INSTANCE>/api/w/<workspace>/scripts/raw/p/<path>.sh
```
