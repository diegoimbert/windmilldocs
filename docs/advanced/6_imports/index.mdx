# Dependency Management & Imports

Windmill's strength lies in its ability to run scripts without having to manage dependency manifest files directly (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.). This is achieved by automatically parsing the imports and resolving the dependencies.

When a script is deployed through its UI, Windmill generates a lockfile to ensure that the same version of a script is always executed with the same versions of its dependencies. If no version is specified, the latest version is used. Windmill's workers cache dependencies to ensure fast performance without the need to pre-package dependencies - most jobs take under 100ms end-to-end.

On the [enterprise edition](/pricing), Windmill's caches can be configured to sync their cache with a central S3 repository to distribute the cache across multiple workers as soon as a new dependency is used for the first time.

## Imports in TypeScript

## Imports in Go

For Go, the dependencies and their versions are contained in the
script and hence there is no need for any additional steps.

e.g:

```go
import (
	"rsc.io/quote"
    wmill "github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-go-client"
)
```

## Imports in PowerShell

For PowerShell, imports are parsed when the script is run and modules are automatically installed if they are not found in the cache.

e.g.:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name MyModule
```

## Dependencies on Local Development

When created and edited through the UI (Windmill App), the lockfile is automatically generated. On [local development](../4_local_development/index.mdx), each script gets:
- a content file (`script_path.py`, `script_path.ts`, `script_path.go`, etc.) that contains the code of the script,
- a metadata file (`script_path.yaml`) that contains the metadata of the script,
- a lockfile (`script_path.lock`) that contains the dependencies of the script.

You can get those 3 files for each script by pulling your workspace with command [`wmill sync pull`](../3_cli/sync.mdx).

Editing a script is as simple as editing its content. The code can be edited freely in your IDE, and there are possibilities to even run it locally if you have the correct development environment setup for the script language.

Some fields of the metadata file can also be edited by hand, like the summary of the description fields. If you update the dependencies of your script, or the signature of the `main` method, the lockfile and/or the script schema will need to be updated. We do not recommend doing it by hand.

The lockfile is not meant to be edited manually. It is generated by Windmill when the script is created or edited through the UI and updated locally with the `wmill script generate-metadata` command. However, it is useful to check versions changes.

[Windmill CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx) command `wmill script generate-metadata` will read all the files that have been edited and gracefully update the metadata file and lockfile accordingly.
This command is mainly used update the lockfile and schema inplace. Be re-assured, any manual update to other files like summary and description will be kept.

For each language, there is a way to pin the version directly. This is the recommended way of managing dependencies and the authoritative way of handling dependencies via the UI.
Locally, the lockfile is respected. It "wins" over the dependencies pinned via the script. Hence the need of the `generate-metadata` command to update the lockfile and metadata files.

## Relative Imports

To import other scripts from your workspace, see [Sharing common logic](../5_sharing_common_logic/index.mdx).

To import from a custom codebase, see [Codebases & Bundles](../../core_concepts/33_codebases_and_bundles/index.mdx).
