# GitHub Integration

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration.

The GitHub integration is done through OAuth. You just need to sign in from your GitHub account on your browser. The access will be automatically saved to the workspace as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx).

You might also look for how to [version control from GitHub / GitLab](../advanced/9_deploy_gh_gl/index.md).

Your resource can be used [passed as parameters](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#passing-resources-as-parameters-to-scripts-preferred) or [directly fetched](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#fetching-them-from-within-a-script-by-using-the-wmill-client-in-the-respective-language) within [scripts](../script_editor/index.mdx), [flows](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) and [apps](../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
