# Git Integration

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Windmill has a dedicated [resource Type](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/135/git_repository) used for [Git Sync](../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx), to sync Windmill workspace to a remote repository that will automatically be committed and pushed scripts, flows and apps on each [deploy](../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx).
