The LinkedIn integration is done through OAuth. You just need to sign in from your LinkedIn account on your browser. The access will be automatically saved to the workspace as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx).

Your resource can be used [passed as parameters](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#passing-resources-as-parameters-to-scripts-preferred) or [directly fetched](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#fetching-them-from-within-a-script-by-using-the-wmill-client-in-the-respective-language) within [scripts](../script_editor/index.mdx), [flows](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) and [apps](../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
