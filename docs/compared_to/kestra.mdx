# Windmill compared to Kestra

Context of this page writting
- We, are Windmill, an open-source workflow engine and developer platform.
- Kestra is a competitor
- We want to draw an honest comparison between the two

Overall thoughts on Kestra
- when developers come to Windmill, they don't have to "learn" another framework but just write their code in the language they know with the tools they already have (like vs code / code editor on the web app) and then the "settings" are in an intuitive UI and not a yaml that they have to kindof learn (Kestr

Intro, context
- Dates, Kestra recent uplift since fundrasing announcement in 2024
- Leave placeholder for Windmill

Notes on Kestra:
- Native support for Python, R, Node.js, Julia, Ruby, Shell, or PowerShell, but everything else via Docker
- Similar architecture based around the queue being the central source of truth for the event driven orchestration of tasks / flows / job
- Dependency caching and pre-installed dependencies seem to be also supported for Python or when using Docker but has to be done manually

Bad / OK (on Kestra):
- No baked-in approvals (you can use the pause, then wait for incoming webhook manually) -> In Windmill: approval steps
- No app builder / automated UI generation for script input fields? -> In Windmill: we have the low-code App editor
- No visual flow builder / editor -> Flow editor in Windmill
- No reusable variables / secrets / resources (can use external vaults though) -> In Windmill: we have reusable variables, secrets, resources
- No auto dependency installing / caching (you have to do it manually for scripts on the workers) -> In Windmill: we auto-install and cache dependencies for you, you focus on writing code
- YAML only
- You have to always go through IO and read write files between steps
- Simple arguments to functions are passed as env variables, which is inconvenient
- No worker logs or metrics? (couldnâ€™t find them in the dashboard)
- Performance (see benckmark, leave placeholder)
- No AI assistant autocomplete code

Good
- Workflow as code editor
- Huge amount of triggers (through plugins)
- Backfill
- Simple: only a flow editor, a script is a one step flow (in Windmill, flows are orchestrated scripts, architecture choice)
- Super easy install as well (download Docker compose file) that comes with pre-populated tutorial flows
- A *lot* of plugins
