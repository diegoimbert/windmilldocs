# Codebases & bundles

:::note

Codebases & bundles is Beta, only works with TypeScript and is an [Enterprise](/pricing) feature for the time being.

:::

The traditional way to handle codebases on Windmill is two-fold:

- Using [relative imports](../../advanced/14_dependencies_in_typescript/index.mdx#sharing-common-logic-with-relative-imports-when-not-using-bundles) to import scripts from the same workspace.
- Deploy a private/public packages and import them in your scripts [using the package manager](../../advanced/14_dependencies_in_typescript/index.mdx#private-npm-registry--private-npm-packages).

</div>

However, that can be inconvenient when working with large codebases.

## Bundles

To work with large codebases, there is another mode of deployment that relies on the same mechanism as similar services like Lambda or cloud functions: a bundle is built locally by the CLI using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and deployed to Windmill.

This bundle contains all the code and dependencies needed to run the script.

On the latest version of the Windmill CLI, it is done automatically on `wmill sync push` for any script that falls in the patterns of includes and excludes as defined by the [wmill.yaml](#wmillyaml).

## wmill.yaml

Here are the changes needed in your [`wmill.yaml`](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-codebase-example/blob/main/windmill/wmill.yaml):

```yaml
---
codebases:
  - relative_path: ../codebase
    includes:
      - '**'
    excludes: []
```

Windmill keeps track of the hash of the codebase and will only rebuild the bundle if the codebase or script has changed.

## Instance object storage

The bundles requires [instance-wide object storage](../38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#instance-object-storage) which is where the bundle resides.

## VS Code extension

This mode of deployment automatically works with the [VS Code extension](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx) to run preview by recognizing the `codebases` configuration in wmill.yaml and bundling scripts on the fly using the same esbuild.
