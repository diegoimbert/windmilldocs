# Private Hub

[Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/) is the community website of Windmill where you can find and share your Scripts, Flows, Apps and Resource Types with every Windmill user. The best submissions get approved by the Windmill Team and get integrated directly in the app for everyone to reuse easily.

On [Enterprise Edition](/pricing) and [Whitelabelling](/pricing), you can have your own Private Hub. This is a private Windmill Hub instance that is only accessible by your team. You can share your scripts, flows, apps and resource types with your team and keep them private. You can also have your own approval process for the submissions and have your own page with your branding.

The private Hub can be partially or totally synced with the public one. This means that you can have your own private scripts, flows, apps and resource types and also have access to the public ones.

If you are interested in having your own Private Hub, please [contact us](mailto:contact@windmill.dev).
