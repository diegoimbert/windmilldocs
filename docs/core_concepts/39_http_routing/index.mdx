# Custom HTTP routes

Windmill supports custom HTTP routes to trigger a script or flow. 
They can only be created by [admins workspace](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#admins-workspace). 
All properties of the route apart from the http path can be modified by any user with write access to the route.

## How to use

Create a new route on the HTTP routes page.
Specify the path of the http route. You can use the `:param` syntax to define parameters.
Parameters can be handled using a [preprocessor](../43_preprocessors/index.mdx).
You also need to select the method of the route (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE).

The full http route takes the following form:
- Self-hosted Windmill: `{base_url}/api/r/{path}`
- Windmill cloud: `https://app.windmill.dev/api/r/{workspace_id}/{path}`

Select the runnable that should be triggered by this route. To quickly get started, you can use the `create from template` button to generate a runnable template.

The route also supports additional configuration options:
- **Request type**: Whether the route should return the id (async) or the result (sync) of the runnable.
- **Authentication**: Whether the route should require authentication. If authentication is required, the user needs to have read access to both the route and the runnable.
