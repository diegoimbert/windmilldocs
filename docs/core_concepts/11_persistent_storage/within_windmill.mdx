# Within Windmill: Not recommended

This page is part of our section on [Persistent Storage & Databases](./index.mdx) which covers where to effectively store and manage the data manipulated by Windmill. Check that page for more options on data storage.

Windmill is not designed to store heavy data that extends beyond the execution of a script or flow. Indeed, for each computation the worker executing is not the same as the previous computation, so the data would have to be retrieved from another location.

Instead, Windmill is very convenient to use alongside data storage providers to manipulate big amounts of data.

There are however internal methods to persist data between executions of jobs.

## States and Resources

Within Windmill, you can use [States](../3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#states) and [Resources](../3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) as a way to store a transient state - that can be represented as small JSON.

### States

States are used by scripts to keep data persistent between runs of the same script by the same trigger (schedule or user).

In Windmill, [States](../3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#states) are considered as resources, but they are excluded from the Workspace tab for clarity.
They are displayed on the Resources menu, under a dedicated tab.

A state is an object stored as a resource of the resource type `state` which is meant to persist across distinct executions of the same script.

```py
import requests
from wmill import set_state, get_state

def main():
	# Get temperature from last execution
    last_temperature = get_state()

    # Fetch the temperature in Paris from wttr.in
    response = requests.get("http://wttr.in/Paris?format=%t")

    new_temperature = response.text.strip("Â°F")

	# Set current temperature to state
    set_state(new_temperature)

    # Compare last_temperature and new_temperature
    if last_temperature < new_temperature:
        return "The temperature has increased."
    elif last_temperature > new_temperature:
        return "The temperature has decreased."
    else:
        return "The temperature has remained the same."
```

States are what enable Flows to watch for changes in most event watching scenarios ([trigger scripts](../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx)). The pattern is as follows:

- Retrieve the last state or, if undefined, assume it is the first execution.
- Retrieve the current state in the external system you are watching, e.g. the
  list of users having starred your repo or the maximum ID of posts on Hacker News.
- Calculate the difference between the current state and the last internal
  state. This difference is what you will want to act upon.
- Set the new state as the current state so that you do not process the
  elements you just processed.
- Return the differences calculated previously so that you can process them in
  the next steps. You will likely want to [forloop](../../flows/12_flow_loops.md) over the items and trigger
  one Flow per item. This is exactly the pattern used when your Flow is in the
  mode of "Watching changes regularly".

The convenience functions do this are:

_TypeScript_

- `getState()` which retrieves an object of any type (internally a simple
  Resource) at a path determined by `getStatePath`, which is unique to the user
  currently executing the Script, the Flow in which it is currently getting
  called in - if any - and the path of the Script.
- `setState(value: any)` which sets the new state.

> Please note it requires [importing](../../advanced/6_imports/index.md) the wmill client library from Deno/Bun.

<br />

_Python_

- `get_state()` which retrieves an object of any type (internally a simple
  Resource) at a path determined by `get_state_path`, which is unique to the user
  currently executing the Script, the Flow in which it is currently getting
  called in - if any - and the path of the Script.
- `set_state(value: Any)` which sets the new state.

### Resources

[States](#states) are a specific type of [resources](../3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) in Windmill where the type is `state` the path is automatically calculated for you based on the schedule path (if any) and the script path. In some cases, you want to set the path arbitrarily and/or use a different type than `state`. In this case, you can use the `setResource` and `getResource` functions. A same resource can be used across different scripts and flows.

- `setResource(value: any, path?: string, initializeToTypeIfNotExist?: string)`: which sets a resource at a given path. This is
  equivalent to `setState` but allows you to set an arbitrary path and chose a type other than state if wanted. [See API](https://deno.land/x/windmill/mod.ts?s=setResource).
- `getResource(path: string)`: gets a resource at a given path. [See API](https://deno.land/x/windmill/mod.ts?s=getResource).

The states can be seen in the Resources section of Windmill app with a
[Resource Type](../3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#create-a-resource-type) of `state`.

:::tip

Variables are similar to resources but have no types, can be tagged as `secret` (in which case they are encrypted by the workspace key) and can only store strings. In some situations, you may prefer `setVariable`/`getVariable` to resources.
:::

In conclusion `setState` and `setResource` are convenient ways to persist json between multiple script executions.

## Shared Directory

For heavier ETL processes or sharing data between steps in a flow, Windmill provides a [Shared Directory](../../flows/3_editor_components.mdx#shared-directory) feature.

The Shared Directory allows steps within a flow to share data by storing it in a designated folder.

:::caution

Although Shared Folders are recommended for persisting states within a flow, it's important to note that all steps are executed on the same worker and the data stored in the Shared Directory is strictly ephemeral to the flow execution.

:::

To enable the Shared Directory, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Settings` menu in the Windmill interface.
2. Go to the `Shared Directory` section.
3. Toggle on the option for `Shared Directory on './shared'`.

![Flow Shared Directory](../../assets/flows/flow_settings_shared_directory.png.webp)

Once the Shared Directory is enabled, you can use it in your flow by referencing the `./shared` folder. This folder is shared among the steps in the flow, allowing you to store and access data between them.

:::tip

Keep in mind that the contents of the `./shared` folder are not preserved across [suspends](../../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx) and [sleeps](../../flows/15_sleep.md). The directory is temporary and active only during the execution of the flow.
