# Service Logs

View logs from any [workers](../9_worker_groups/index.mdx) or servers directly within the service logs section of the [search modal](../35_search_bar/index.mdx).

Windmill provides direct access to the logs emitted by containers, removing the need to manually retrieve them from Docker or other container platforms. This enables monitoring services without needing to leave the Windmill environment.

You can view them from the [Workers](../9_worker_groups/index.mdx) page, in particular:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: While logs are emitted continuously, there is a 1-minute latency before they appear in the interface.
- **Visual Graphs**: You can easily track the number of logs and errors over time, displayed in a graphical interface:
  - **Log Count**: Displayed in the mini-graph, showing how many logs were generated each minute.
  - **Error Count**: Displayed in red, highlighting errors separately for quick identification.
- **Separation by Type**: Logs are organized by type. You can see logs for workers, servers and indexers.

In future releases, we plan to introduce a powerful search capability for logs, integrated directly into the search modal. This feature will be exclusive to the Enterprise Edition, enabling users to quickly search across logs for specific events, errors, or patterns.

## Log Storage

Windmill provides a flexible solution for log storage depending on your setup:

- **Standard Setup** (without [Enterprise Edition](/pricing)):
  Logs are stored locally on disk. For this to work, there must be a dedicated log disk, which is pre-configured in the Docker Compose setup.
  
- **Enterprise Edition** (with [Instance object storage](../38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#instance-object-storage)):
  For users with the Enterprise Edition (EE), logs can be stored in S3 if instance object storage is configured. This option provides more scalable storage and is ideal for larger-scale deployments or where long-term log retention is important.
