# Workspace Secret Encryption

When updating the encryption key of a workspace, all [secrets](../2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx#secrets) will be re-encrypted with the new key and the previous key will be replaced by the new one.

If you're manually updating the key to match another workspace key from another Windmill instance, make sure not to use the 'SECRET_SALT' environment variable or, if you're using it, make sure it the salt matches across both instances.

The encryption key should be 64 characters long and only contain letters and numbers.
