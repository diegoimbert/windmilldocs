# Kafka triggers

Windmill can connect to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) brokers servers and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) when a message is received.
Listening is done from the servers, so it doesn't take up any workers.
Kafka triggers are not available on the [Cloud](/pricing).

## How to use

Create a new trigger on the Kafka triggers page.
Add a Kafka resource with the broker hostnames (hostname:port) and the security settings.
Specify the topics the trigger should listen to.
The group id is automatically filled in from the current workspace and the trigger path. You can change it if necessary.
It indicates the consumer group to which the trigger belongs. This garantees that even if the trigger stops listening for a while, it will receive the messages it missed when it starts listening again.

Once the Kafka resource and settings are set, select the runnable that should be triggered by this trigger.
The received webhook message will be passed to the runnable as a string argument called `msg`.
If you use a preprocessor, the `wm_trigger` object will be of the form:

```json
{
  "kind": "kafka",
  "kafka": {
    "brokers": ["localhost:9092"],
    "topic": "my-topic", 
    "group_id": "my-group-id"
  }
}
```
