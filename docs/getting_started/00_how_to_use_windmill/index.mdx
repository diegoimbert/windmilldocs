# Getting Started with Windmill

Windmill is a fast, **<a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill">open-source</a>** workflow engine and developer platform. It's an alternative to the likes of Retool, Superblocks, n8n, Airflow, and Temporal, designed to **build comprehensive internal tools** (endpoints, workflows, UIs). It supports coding in Typescript, Python, Go, Bash, SQL, or any Docker image, alongside intuitive low-code builders.

## Choose Your Setup

### Windmill Cloud

Quickly get started with our [Cloud App](https://app.windmill.dev/), no credit card required. Sign up using GitHub, GitLab, Google, or Microsoft SSO. Start with 1,000 monthly executions on our Community Plan, and easily upgrade for more. [Start with Windmill Cloud](https://app.windmill.dev/).

### Self-Hosting Windmill

For full control over your infrastructure, self-host Windmill using our [helm charts](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts) for Kubernetes or docker-compose for simpler setups. [Learn how to self-host Windmill](/docs/advanced/self_host/).

## Development Options

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Windmill supports development directly within its [built-in IDE](../../code_editor/index.mdx), tailored for creating scripts, workflows, and UIs efficiently.

### Local Development
Prefer your own setup? No problem. Windmill integrates smoothly with local environments, including a [VS Code extension](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx) and tools for [Git-based deployment to production](../../advanced/12_deploy_to_prod/index.mdx). [Explore local development options](/docs/advanced/local_development).
