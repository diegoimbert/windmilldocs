description: We have released our new Windmill Billing Portal https://portal.windmill.dev/. <br><br> You can access your Portal from your Instance Settings, in the "Core" tab. Or by visiting https://portal.windmill.dev/, entering your email and then accessing the link sent via email. Update contact information, billing details and subscription (seats & vCPUs) from the portal. From there, you can also enable/disable any time automatic renewal and automatic debit (therefore payment by invoice).<br><br>In the Usage section, you can find the Seats of vCPUs usage of your Prod instance, and check whether your use of Windmill corresponds to your subscription. There is a ‘Report an error’ button, please use it if reported usage is incorrect.<br><br>It's also an opportunity for us to explain our new way of managing license keys for self-hosted instances.<br><br>As you know, when you subscribe to Windmill, you receive a license key to enter in the instance settings. Now, this key automatically updates every day as long as the subscription is valid. A key is valid for 35 days and expires as soon as an updated key replaces it. This system relieves you from having to worry about your key expiring. Now everything is automatic as long as your subscription is valid. You can still contact us for exceptions.
