description: All secrets of a workspace are encrypted with a symmetric key unique to that workspace. This key is generated when the workspace is created and is stored in the database in the workspace_settings. You can now manually update the encryption key of a workspace, it will be re-encrypted with the new key and the previous key will be replaced by the new one.
